I think most of the functions were pretty self explanatory. Negative image was subtracting the rgb value from 255. Flipping was done with a temporary variable where the pixels from the top half were replaced by those of the bottom and then put at the bottom. Horizontal mirror was assigning the rgb values to the right half of the image which was accessed by subtracting the width by x+1 from the for loop. My sharpen function isn’t complete as it doesn’t take into account the border pixels. However it starts at pixel (1,1) and multiplies that value  by 9 and subtracts the surrounding pixels. This is done for each color channel and is stored in a different variable (Rsum, Gsum, and Bsum), which are arrays. I then have a series of if statements to check if the sum variables are greater than 255 or less than 0 and deal with those values accordingly. Finally I have another series of for loops to assign each color channel in each pixel the “sharpened” value by type casting the arrays to unsigned chars. I also have my add border extra credit function and I did 4 if statements that each took care of a side of the image. Basically if the for loop x value was within the range of bwidth and bwidth was less than the width, it would change the pixel to black. This was done with the for loop y value and then with another parameter being that width - x was less than bwidth, which was for the right side of the image.
